Elevator Pitch
==============

Add a discussion forum to your webpage with a single line of JavaScript.

To comment, log in through Persona and re-use that account across the web.

As the site owner, forget spammy commenting systems at the bottom of the page.
Get a rich, full screen forum which doesn't take users away from your website.
These forums drive new traffic.

You don't have to force your user's to learn a new password or lock them
into their Facebook Identity on your site.

As a reader, you get a fast and easy way to discuss the web.

Private communities make deep discussions with trusted parterns possible.

Bookmarklets or Addons make Sidebar available on websites which haven't been natively integrated.

Sane defaults inhibit spam, trolls, and reward your genuine audience in the public forum.
