# 50,000 Foot View

This is the 50,000 foot overview of Sidebar.

Website creators need a simple, cool way to add an integrated discussion forum
to any webpage.

Sidebar and Persona solve this problem. The following can be dropped into any page:

    <script src="http://bottomhalf.org/comments.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

When some visits their website, they will see a call to action to discuss this page.
They will be prompted to leave a comment, which requires signing in with Persona.
A name, avatar, and an optional website url will be collected. The user can then leave comments.

When the user clicks the call to action, a full screen forum slides in, creating a trusted and robust discussion forum. The current forum thread is for the page being viewed.

Comments are displayed in chronological order and threaded. In addition to profile information, they have the formatted commment, and a date. Comment formatting is severely limited to safe and sane capabilities.

Comments will be held for moderation for new users, and automatically posted for trusted users.

Websites creators can moderate comments, once they have claimed ownership of a website. Their avatar will highlight their status as the creator of the website. They can approve and delete comments. BottomHalf will provide them with a dashboard of all comments across all their pages, for easy bulk moderation.

**Commenters**, these are the visitors to these websites, will have an **easy sign in** experience on the next website they visit that uses BottomHalf. They will confirm if they want to use their current identity, or sign in as a different one.

Commenters can see how many comments have been made in the general public space, as well as in any of the niche community spaces they have set up. They can choose to make a new comment in any of these spaces.

For example, I could create a private "Identity" invite only forum, which would show up in my Sidebar tab across the web. This community of practise could have a private, trusted, deep conversation about the page in a way that would not be possible in the general public forum.

Commenters can delete a comment that they have previously created. They cannot edit or update an existing comment.

Comments will be stored "in the cloud". Commenters own the comments they've made in the past and can easily get the data. Website creators own all the comments made against their website and can easily get all of the data.

A creator or website commenter **cannot** discover data about others outside of the current website. Example: Amy comments on a Pets blog. Jill (also on the Pets blog) looks at all the comments Amy has made in the past, to evaluate if Amy is a lunatic. **Jill cannot discover that Amy also recently commented on a Physics blog**.

Users can receive email updates as others like or reply to their comments.

Users can leave the current forum thread by navigating to:
* Other active discussions on the current website
* Trending pages
* Switch to a different community

Trending pages drive new user traffic to website owners and provide content discovery to Commenters.
