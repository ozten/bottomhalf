# What is 80 / 20 / 2?

At Mozilla we talk about the 80 / 20 / 2 rule.

80% of people using a system will frequent 20% of your
system, so sayeth a UX version of the Pareto principle.

To confuse things, we tend to talk about 80% features,
being the features people use 80% of the time. The
80% use case.

These 80% features are mandatory for a finished product.
You should spend most of your time making them perfect.

The 20% space can be added, but should never distract
or obscure the design and access of the 80. These 20% features
are for power user features or infrequently needed options.

Being Mozilla, **we account for 102% of people's experience**...

The remaining 2% of people will be the super vocal mintory,
super-super users who have grey beards and can walk through walls.
Do not optimize for these 2%.

So 80% of time with 20% of your features can be mapped into an 
80/20/2 feature list.

* 80 features - manditory, closest, largest
* 20 features - optional, add with maturity
* 2 features - optional, we'll probably never get there, or may not want to...
