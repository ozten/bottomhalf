# BottomHalf
A Persona powered commenting service for webpages

## Elevator Pitch

Persona based comments for the web!

Add a commenting system to your webpage with a single line of JavaScript.

To comment, log in through Persona and re-use that account across the web.
As the site owner, a simple moderation system keeps things sane.

You don't have to force your user's to learn a new password or lock them
into their Facebook Identity on your site.

As a reader, you get a fast and easy way to comment on the web.

Sane defaults inhibit spam, trolls, and reward your genuine audience.
